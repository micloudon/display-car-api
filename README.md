# Car Search
### This is a React Project that allows the user to search for different kinds of cars      
<br/>
It works in tandum with a project that I made previously:  
https://github.com/micloudon/carApi

It pulls data from this api in the form of Json objects

**Useful React commands:**  
Start your project:
>npx create-react-app yourprojectname  

Run dev server:
>yarn start

Install dependencies
>yarn add
